# Docker Examples

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization technology. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

## Why Docker Exists

Before Docker, developers faced the infamous "it works on my machine" problem. Applications would run differently across development, testing, and production environments due to inconsistencies in system configurations. Docker was created to solve this problem by providing a standardized way to package and run applications regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

## Problems Docker Solves

- **Environment Consistency**: Eliminates discrepancies between development, testing, and production environments
- **Application Isolation**: Containers run in isolation without interfering with each other or the host system
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight than virtual machines
- **Rapid Deployment**: Containers can be started, stopped, and scaled in seconds
- **Version Control for Infrastructure**: Docker images can be versioned, allowing for consistent application deployments
- **Microservices Architecture**: Facilitates breaking down applications into smaller, independently deployable services

## How to Use Docker

### Basic Docker Commands

```bash
# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull image_name:tag

# Run a container
docker run [options] image_name:tag

# List running containers
docker ps

# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t image_name:tag .

# Stop a running container
docker stop container_id

# Remove a container
docker rm container_id
```

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a YAML file, you can configure your application's services and start all services with a single command.

```bash
# Start services defined in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```
