## Pipeline Types

### Build Pipelines

Build pipelines handle the compilation, testing, and artifact creation processes. They typically include:

- Code checkout
- Dependency installation
- Compilation (if applicable)
- Unit and integration testing
- Code quality checks
- Artifact generation

### PR Merge Pipelines

These pipelines are triggered when pull requests are merged into main branches. They often include:

- Automated testing
- Code quality validation
- Documentation updates
- Notification systems

### Release Pipelines

Release pipelines manage the deployment of applications to various environments. Key features include:

- Environment-specific configurations
- Deployment strategies (blue/green, canary, etc.)
- Database migrations
- Post-deployment verification
- Rollback mechanisms

### Tagging Pipelines

Triggered when tags are created, these pipelines handle versioning and often include:

- Semantic versioning enforcement
- Release notes generation
- Artifact publishing
- Container image tagging

## Usage

These templates can be adapted for use with various CI/CD platforms such as:

- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- Jenkins
- CircleCI
- Azure DevOps

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Copy the appropriate template for your language and scenario
2. Modify environment variables and configuration settings
3. Add or remove steps as needed for your specific project
4. Ensure secrets are properly managed (never hardcode sensitive information)
5. Test the pipeline in a development environment before deploying to production

## Best Practices

- Keep pipelines as simple as possible while meeting requirements
- Use parameterization for flexibility
- Implement proper error handling and notifications
- Include comprehensive logging
- Consider performance optimization for faster builds
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use consistent naming conventions
